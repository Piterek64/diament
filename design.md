## Technical Implementation

**Core Libraries Used**:
1. **Anime.js** - Smooth animations and transitions
2. **p5.js** - Creative coding for background effects and interactive elements
3. **ECharts.js** - Data visualization for statistics and comparisons
4. **Splide.js** - Image carousels and testimonial sliders
5. **Typed.js** - Typewriter effects for dynamic text
6. **Splitting.js** - Advanced text animation effects
7. **Matter.js** - Physics-based interactions
8. **Pixi.js** - High-performance visual effects
9. **Leaflet** - Interactive maps for city locations

**Header Effects**:
- Animated gradient background using CSS and JavaScript
- Floating particle system with p5.js
- Dynamic text effects with color cycling
- Smooth parallax scrolling elements

**Interactive Elements**:
- Hover animations with scale and glow effects
- Button morphing on interaction
- Card lift effects with shadow depth

- Loading states with progress indicators

**Layout & Spacing**:
- Grid-based layout system with consistent spacing
- Responsive breakpoints: 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px
- Vertical rhythm based on 1.5rem baseline
- Generous white space for premium feel
- Asymmetrical layouts for visual interest

**Background Treatment**:
- Consistent gradient background throughout all pages

- Form inputs with focus states and validation feedback
- Navigation with smooth transitions and active states
- Modals and overlays with backdrop blur effects

**Accessibility Considerations**:
- High contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1)
- Focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Screen reader friendly markup
- Reduced motion preferences respected
- Semantic HTML structure

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Lazy loading for images and heavy components
- Optimized animations with transform and opacity
- Efficient scroll event handling
